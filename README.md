# Transfer_Learning_2_Fine_tuning
In this project I used 10_food_classes data. The dataset is organized into 2 folders (train, test) and contains subfolders for each car category. There are 10.000 images (JPG) and 10 classes(chicken_curry, chicken_wings, fried_rice, grilled_salmon, hamburger, ice_cream, pizza, ramen, steak, sushi) in this data. I used EfficientNetV2B0 model in this task and took 1, 10 and finally all data for training process.
